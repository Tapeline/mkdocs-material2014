# Material 1 for Mkdocs

<p style="font-size: 1.5rem">Documentation that simply works like it's 2014</p>

There's this truly amazing project, called 
[Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

Although it's pretty darn amazing in terms of features, it lacks the feeling
of original Material Design 1. So I've tried to create my own material theme.
