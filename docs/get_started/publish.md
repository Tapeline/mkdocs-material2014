# Build and publish

When your documentation is ready, you might want to show it to the world.

## Build

To build, simply use mkdocs:

```shell
mkdocs build
```

This will give you a static site in form of HTML, CSS and JS files,
which you can then host anywhere you'd like.

## Publishing with GitHub Pages

You can use GitHub Pages, if your repository is located there already.
Here is an example GitHub Action to use:

```yml
# to be written
```
